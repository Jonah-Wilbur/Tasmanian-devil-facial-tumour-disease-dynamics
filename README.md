This is part of a larger project I did investigating the potnetial for conservation of Tasmanian Devils, as they have exceptionally low genetic diversity and are threatened by the Devil Facial Tumour Disease epidemic.
We used this model to investigate the impacts of potential treatments on the future population size and dynamics, inferring the implications on genetic diversity of any population bottleneck points.  
The text describing my R0 calculations is in my report.
